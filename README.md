- Terraform
- AWS CLI

**Step 2:** Create a directory the name of directory is Three-tier-architecture in that directory creates a supported files are.
1. Main.tf (web + app + db)

2. Variables.tf (Variables definition)

3. Terraform.tfvars

4. Output.tf (Output like public IP, DB endpoints)

**Step 3 :** Use the terraform commands to deploy the three-tier architecture.

1. terraform init
2. terraform plan
3. terraform apply

**Step 4 :** Create the index.html (sample webpage) in the web-tier instance and copy the public ip of server and paste them to the browser and check it works properly.
